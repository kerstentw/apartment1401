=============

This is a WebGame/Desktop platform for building a slideshow
based application.

It is also my first attempt at tkinter and one of many attempts at 
building with web.py.  Eventually, I will add images of my own 
making into the app to tell a story and give the app a sense of 
space.  It is meant to have a retro feel.

Remaining tasks:

1.) Place the desktop app into a cleaner layout.
2.) Build the traversal engine for both.
3.) Add images.
4.) Finish building HTML
5.) Create a WSGI handler for the web application
6.) Think of more tasks to complete because there are lots of them...
